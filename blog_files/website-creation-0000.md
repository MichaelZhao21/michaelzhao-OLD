# Creating my Personal Website

## 5/5/20 | First Day

### Code Setup

First step of the process was getting up a framework. For this, I wanted to use React.js with Node.js. First, I used `npx` to create a basic file structure:

```bash
npx create-react-app [appName]
```

This generated a rather ugly file structure, so the rest of the day was spent cleaning up the file system and removing a lot of the excess files.

### Design

I drew up a basic outline of the first iteration of the website, which would obviously be improved upon, but it's not bad for a first design:

A lot of the day was spent coming up with ideas for designing the webpage and logo for my website. Here's a list of helpful links that I can reference if needed:

- [The Definitive guide to Dark theme UI Design](https://uxdesign.cc/dark-mode-ui-design-the-definitive-guide-part-1-color-53dcfaea5129)

Here's the initial design of the logo I drew up in Photoshop. I like the colors and gradient; kinda very iffy on the design though

### Reflections

I am going to focus on creating routing between pages and getting a working blog system up first before I do the main page. A bit of CSS is probably going to be needed to make the blog look nice, but we're going for MINIMAL on the blog. The front page I want to be interactive in some sense (WebGL????) even to the point of a game :OOOO????? Overall, nothing drastically difficult has come up; it's just been me thinking of ideas and learning react :DDD

### TODO

- Make new icon (TODO: Change logo.svg)
- Create routing system
- Create framework for blog
- Still clean up file system
