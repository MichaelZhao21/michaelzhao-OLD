        "In a world filled with oppression and violence, there are countless people speaking out against societal issues both online and in person. Over the course of the past two weeks, I’ve seen hundreds of social media posts across all platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, Reddit, etc) discussing the current social issues, and I’m not going to lie, I’ve been quiet about these issues up until now. As an Asian American growing up in a community with a majority of Asians, I’ve never felt seriously out of place or alienated. As such, I’ve sat at home in a state of contentment for way too long. I can admit to being a part of the privileged who sit by and watch the world fall apart, completely ignorant to what I can do to help.",
        "However, as I started doing my own research, I saw how much I needed to speak out. This is the website that I’ll be maintaining and keeping up with. I’ll be talking about a series of issues and trying my best to base my arguments on facts, but keep in mind that I’m still a person with biases that might conflict with yours. I’ve marked the editorial/opinionated subsections with an opinion tag; those will appear at the bottom of each section. Feel free to message me about anything because I want to keep an open mind on these issues. I’ll try to keep this website updated and make changes that I see fit. Please don’t harass people or make blatantly rude and insensitive comments. At the end of the day, I’m just another person witnessing this situation, and I want to make sure that everyone is knowledgeable about the issues with our current world. I highly encourage you to speak out, donate, protest, and do whatever you can to help out, even if it’s small because everyone has the power to make an impact on this situation. The first page is a list of resources for you to help out. Stay safe and stay strong. I love you all <333"

Black Lives Matter Foundation, Inc is a global organization in the US, UK, and Canada, whose mission is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes. By combating and countering acts of violence, creating space for Black imagination and innovation, and centering Black joy, we are winning immediate improvements in our lives.”",
        "Starting on a local level, the Black Lives Matter Movement was originally meant to help build local Black power and speak out against violence happening to the Black community unfairly. Since then, they’ve expanded globally and committed to creating a world free of anti-Blackness, where every Black person has the “the social, economic, and political power to thrive.” (blacklivesmatter.com)",

        "Over and over again, black people are being killed by police for the color of their skin. These names and this story is a reminder to people that so little has changed. None of these people deserve death. None of their families deserved to watch as their child or brother or parents get killed because of the color of their skin. No one ever deserves to feel unsafe purely because of how they look. Yet this situation isn’t getting better. More and more instances of brutality and racism towards blacks are happening yet little to no change being done by the people in power. Learn their names. Read their stories. Remember the people who died. Take action. That’s the only way for the situation to get better.",
